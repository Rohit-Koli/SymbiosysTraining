Exception Handling :
	Programmer Mistakes
	Abnormal Condition
	
	Exception :
	types:
		checked Exception:
			compile time Exception
				extend the class CompileTimeException
		unchecked Exception :
			Runtime Exception
				extend the class RuntimeException
				
	We can skip catch block nut we have to use finally block to use try 
Finally Block:
	It should be the last statement of program
	It is executed always ,whether Exception occurs or not

Custom Exception :
	user defined exception
	we can create our own exception 
	
	
throw keyword :
	we can able to pass the exception to another class
	we can pass custom exception as well as predefined exceptions also
	
	ex :
	if(marks<40)
		throw new InvalidMarksException();
		
	we cannot use any statement after the throw keyboard
		
Important :
	we cannot throws checked exception through override methods if we have to throws any exception
	then we have to throw it through it's parent class
