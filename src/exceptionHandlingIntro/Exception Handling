	Exception :
	types:
		checked Exception:
			compile time Exception
				extend the class CompileTimeException

				extend the class RuntimeException

Finally Block:
	It should be the last statement of program
	It is executed always ,whether Exception occurs or not

Custom Exception :
	user defined exception

	if(marks<40)
		throw new InvalidMarksException();
